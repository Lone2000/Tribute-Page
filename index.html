        <p class="quote">Imagine a poll to choose the best-known mathematician of the twentieth century. No doubt the winner
          would be John von Neumann. Reasons are seen, for instance, in the title of the excellent biography [M]
          by Macrae: John von Neumann. The Scientific Genius who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game
          Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More. Indeed, he was a fundamental figure not only in
          designing modern computers but also in defining their place in society and envisioning their potential.
          His minimax theorem, the first theorem of game theory, and later his equilibrium model of economy,
          essentially inaugurated the new science of mathematical economics. He played an important role in
          the development of the atomic bomb. However, behind all these, he was a brilliant mathematician. My
          goal here is to concentrate on his development and achievements as a mathematician and the evolution of his mathematical interests.</p>

          <p class="p2-text">Von Neumann’s principal contribution to the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Trinity test device. Von Neumann’s hydrogen bomb work was also played out in the realm of computing, where he and fellow physicist Stanislaw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann’s digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>From <span>1926 to 1927</span> Von Neumann did postdoctoral studies under David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen.</li>
            <li>In <span>1932</span> Von Neumann published his book “The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics” which established a strong mathematical framework for quantum physics.</li>
            <li>He published “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” in <span>1944</span> which detailed a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.</li>
            <li>The year before, in <span>1956</span> , he had received the first Enrico Fermi Award.</li>
            <li>John Neumann died in <span>February 8, 1957 (aged 53)</span> from bone cancer in Washington, D.C., United States.</li>
